Arrays in Java script are dynamic in nature ( Dynamic sized) 
============================================

push() & pop()     ## Insert at last Index/ Delete last Index

unshift() & shift()  ## Insert at First/Begnining or Delete at the begining

Note: You can insert at any index, i.e. if an array[4] , you can insert at a[10]=5 , all other index in b/w will be empty


Note: In JS & Python , Actual Values (elements are not store in continous location)
Instead, "reference"- of those elements are stored in continous location , That why we can store different typed of data-types in an array in JS & Python
